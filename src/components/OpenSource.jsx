      <p className="text-gray-300 dark:text-gray-900 mb-6">
        Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sandeep, a passionate developer who recently embarked on the exciting journey
        into the world of open source contributions. In 2023, I participated in Hacktoberfest, an event
        that ignited my interest in contributing to open source projects.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-300 dark:text-gray-900 mb-6">
        During Hacktoberfest, I successfully merged 4 pull requests, and the experience was incredible!
        It allowed me to collaborate with other developers, learn new technologies, and make meaningful
        contributions to various projects.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-300 dark:text-gray-900 mb-6">
        The sense of community and the satisfaction of seeing my contributions in action have motivated
        me to continue my journey in open source. I am actively exploring new projects, identifying
        issues, and contributing my skills to make a positive impact on the developer community.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-300 dark:text-gray-900">
        I believe in the power of collaboration and am excited about the endless possibilities that
        open source offers. Let's build, learn, and grow together!
